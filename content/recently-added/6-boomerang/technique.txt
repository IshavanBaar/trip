Description: 

Boomerang is a gesture technique to drag-and-drop objects over long distances.

In Boomerang you throw the objects to the side of the screen, where they disappear. A place to catch the objects appears. When you are ready, you can move the cursor there, and the objects drop back. In the meantime, you can switch the window or change the view.

The direction of the throwing gesture can also invoke commands. For example, it can copy or remove the dragged objects.
